== GE_Compass ==
''A simple Compass for mobile devices''

Yes it is a compass. What else can I say?

It is written with the [http://phonegap.com Phonegap] API (aka Cordova 2.1.0), so it should run on any 
device [http://phonegap.com/about/feature supported by phonegap].

It is available for Android on [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gorillaeis.android.ge_compass Google Play].
